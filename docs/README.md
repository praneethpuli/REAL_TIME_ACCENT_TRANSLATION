# REAL_TIME_ACCENT_TRANSLATION

Project Overview
The Real-Time Accent Translation System aims to facilitate effective communication across linguistic barriers
by providing real-time accent translation during conversations. This project leverages advanced speech recognition,
accent detection, and translation technologies to convert spoken language into text, adapt it to a desired accent, 
and synthesize it back into speech. The system is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible 
for individuals from diverse backgrounds and regions.

Key Features
Speech-to-Text Conversion: Accurately transcribes spoken language into text using a robust Speech-to-Text API, 
enabling real-time understanding of spoken content.

Accent Detection: Identifies the speaker's accent and classifies it to facilitate appropriate accent adaptation.

Accent Adaptation: Modifies the transcribed text to match the desired accent using machine learning models, 
enhancing clarity and comprehension for the listener.

Text-to-Speech Synthesis: Converts the adapted text back into speech in the target accent, ensuring seamless communication.

Real-Time Processing: Provides immediate feedback and responses, enabling fluid conversations without noticeable delays.

User-Friendly Interface: Features an intuitive interface for easy interaction and audio capture, 
allowing users to engage with the system effortlessly.
