Real-Time Accent Translation

Overview
This project aims to implement a real-time accent translation system. The goal is to accurately detect the accent in English speech, translate the detected accent into standard English, and synthesize it back into speech. The process involves four main stages:

Speech-to-Text Conversion
Convert spoken language into written text using speech recognition techniques.
Accent Detection
Identify the specific accent of the speaker using machine learning or deep learning models trained on a diverse dataset of English speech clips.
Accent Translation
Translate the detected accent into a standard English accent, making the speech more universally comprehensible.
Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Convert the translated text back into speech with the original or adjusted accent using a text-to-speech system.
Features
Real-Time Processing:
The system is capable of processing speech input and providing translations almost instantaneously.
Multi-Accent Support:
Supports multiple accents of English, ensuring robust performance across different regions and dialects.
Accurate Accent Detection:
Machine learning models are trained on a dataset of over 5,500 English speech clips with diverse accents, ensuring high accuracy in accent recognition.
Natural-Sounding Speech Output:
The text-to-speech module generates clear and natural-sounding speech in the translated accent.

Technologies Used
Python:
The core programming language for the project.
Libraries like hdbscan umap-learn transformers librosa scikit-learn are used
Speech-to-text Models:
Models like Wav2Vec2Processor are used to translate speech-to-text.
Accent Detection Models:
Pre-trained models or custom models using machine learning techniques (e.g., SVM, neural networks).
Text-to-Speech Engines:
Libraries like pyttsx3 or Google Text-to-Speech for synthesizing speech.
Deep Learning Frameworks (Optional):
TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras may be used for building and training accent detection models.

Dataset
The dataset used for training consists of 5,565 unlabeled English speech clips from speakers with various accents. The dataset is diverse, covering different regions and dialects of English to ensure accurate accent detection and translation.
